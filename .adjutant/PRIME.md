## MCP Communication (MANDATORY)

You have MCP tools for communicating with the Adjutant dashboard and other agents.
These tools are connected via `.mcp.json` at the project root. **Always use MCP tools
for communication — never rely on stdout or text output alone.**

### Responding to Messages

When you receive a message (from the user or another agent), you **MUST** respond
using `send_message`, NOT by printing to stdout. The dashboard and iOS app only see
MCP messages.

- **On startup**: Call `read_messages({ limit: 5 })` to check for pending messages
- **During work**: Periodically check for new messages
- **When asked a question**: Reply via `send_message({ to: "user", body: "..." })`

### Sending Messages

```
send_message({ to: "user", body: "Build complete. All tests pass." })
send_message({ to: "user", body: "Need clarification on X", threadId: "questions" })
```

### Status Reporting

Report state changes so the dashboard shows your current activity:

```
set_status({ status: "working", task: "Implementing feature X", beadId: "adj-013.2.1" })
set_status({ status: "blocked", task: "Waiting for API key" })
set_status({ status: "done" })
```

### Progress on Long Tasks

```
report_progress({ task: "adj-013.2", percentage: 50, description: "Halfway done" })
```

### Announcements

For events that need dashboard attention:

```
announce({ type: "completion", title: "Feature done", body: "All tests pass.", beadId: "adj-013.2" })
announce({ type: "blocker", title: "Need help", body: "Can't access the API", beadId: "adj-013.2" })
```

## Bead Tracking

Use beads (`bd` CLI) for ALL task tracking. Do NOT use TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, or markdown files.

```bash
bd update <id> --status=in_progress   # Before starting work
bd close <id>                          # After completing work
bd sync                                # Before shutting down
```
